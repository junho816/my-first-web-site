<h2>JavaScript이란 무엇인가?</h2>
It appears you might be referring to "Single Component Composition"<br>
(SCC), which is not a widely recognized term or concept in the context of JavaScript programming.<br> 
If you could provide more details or clarify your question,<br>
I'd be happy to assist you with any JavaScript-related inquiries you have.<br>
Are you looking for information about a specific JavaScript<br>
library, framework, concept, or something else? Please provide additional context so I can assist you better.<br>
